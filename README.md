# Text-Editor-App

## Description

```md
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```

My goal was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. There are additional tasks that I was required to meet as well. We used the client and server side to show a full stack PWA on a webpage. We were given a package called `idb` to help collect the data. I used a lot of this past week's assignments to help with this challenge.
